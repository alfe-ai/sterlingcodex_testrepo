Once upon a pantry shelf, a small potato named Pip dreamed of becoming the crispiest fry in the county fair.
Each night Pip practiced rolling and tumbling so their edges would be perfectly golden when the day came.
When harvest arrived, Pip landed in the hands of a kind cook who celebrated effort over size.
Pip sizzled into a fry that crunched like applause, proving even a humble spud can chase a delicious dream.
