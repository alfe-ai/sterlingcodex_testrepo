# The Banana Heist: A Monkey's Tale

In a bright corner of the jungle, a mischievous monkey named Pico spotted a gleaming bounty: a stash of ripe bananas stacked like treasure.

Pico hatched a plan: practice his stealth, blend with the vines, and nimbly nab the bananas without waking the sleepy parrot on the branch above.

First attempt failed when his tail gave a dramatic wag every time he whispered, “This will be easy.” The parrots squawked in surprise, bananas wobbling, and Pico pretended it was part of his dance.

He tried distraction: he stacked coconuts to lure a curious monkey from the guard post—a tiny drumbeat of clinks and clanks. But the coconuts rolled away, the guard monkey chasing after them while Pico slipped away with a single banana in triumph. Then a louder sigh: he had only one banana left.

Finally, Pico realized the best scam wasn’t stealing, but sharing. He returned the stash in exchange for stories, laughter, and a promise from the jungle friends to split the haul next time. They elected Pico “Honorary Bananas Keeper,” which meant more bananas, less trouble, and a lot of giggles.

Moral: Sometimes the best heist is the one that brings everyone together.
