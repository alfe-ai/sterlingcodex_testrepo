# Waffle Story V2

Wally the Waffle woke to the gentle hum of a sleepy kitchen. The sun spilled through the window and painted golden stripes on the plate. Wally dreamed of adventure beyond the breakfast table.

One morning, a brave crumb named Pip floated down from the sugar bowl and whispered: "The World of Breakfast awaits." Wally strapped on a tiny maple-map, drawn by the dew on the syrup, and slid toward the edge of the plate.

The table was a vast forest of napkins and forks; the chair legs were towering cliffs. Wally met a butter bear named Buttercup, who taught him about patience and warmth. Buttercup melted just a little, then gave Wally a patch of buttery trail to follow.

At the edge of the plate, a river of milk flowed. Wally hesitated—the current looked strong. Pip encouraged him: "Turn the milk into a bridge with your crunch." Wally pressed down, creating a little crispy arch. He stepped across and felt taller, braver.

On the other side, he discovered a clue: a note written in cinnamon dust. It read, "Sharing makes the breakfast brighter." Wally realized the best adventures are shared with friends. He filled Pip's tiny pocket with crumbs to carry back home.

When Wally returned to his plate, he wasn't the same waffle. He was a storyteller, a builder of bridges, and a keeper of warm mornings. The kitchen woke brighter, and everyone cheered for Wally's first voyage.

From that day on, Wally welcomed every new breakfast guest with a story, a crumb, and a smile, proving that even a small waffle can make a big breakfast world.
