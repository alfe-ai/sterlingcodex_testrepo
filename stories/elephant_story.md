The Elephant Who Remembered Rain

In a dusty savanna, an old elephant named Kito carried memories as heavy as his tusks. He remembered every rain that had fallen in a dozen seasons: the sounds, the smells, the way the grass drank the sky and grew tall enough to tickle his trunk.

One dry season, a tiny mouse named Luma asked, "Why do you keep so many memories?" Kito lowered his head and whispered, "Memories are rain that never leaves the earth. When the clouds forget to come, I plant the old rains in my heart and still feel the coolness in the air."

As weeks stretched into months, animals gathered around the lone watering hole, telling stories of past storms. Kito listened, and with every tale, a memory slipped forward—a memory of a river that once overflowed, of grass that sang, of friends who stood by him through floods and droughts.

When a cloud finally arrived, the air grew heavy with the scent of rain. The elephants trumpeted, the zebras danced, and Luma looked up at Kito with wide eyes. He lifted his trunk to the sky and released a gentle, remembered rain into the wind, a blessing from the storm he had carried for years.

Moral: Remembering the past can water the future, helping others find hope when the dry season lingers.
