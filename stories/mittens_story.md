# The Mittens That Remember Winter

On a morning when the first snow whispered against the window, Niko found a pair of knitted mittens tucked inside an old book. They were bright blue with tiny silver stars along the cuffs, and they felt warm even before they touched his skin.

As soon as he slid his hands inside, the room filled with a soft glow and a quiet drumbeat seemed to echo from the snow outside. The mittens spoke not with words, but with memories: the scent of cocoa, the creak of a wind-blown gate, and the laughter of a family long gone but not forgotten.

With the mittens on, Niko stepped into the street. The snowflakes drifted like pale feathers, and the world paused to listen. He found a girl named Mina crying at the edge of the park; she had lost her grandmother’s scarf and was afraid to step into the white forest beyond. The mittens warmed his hands and roused him to help. He offered Mina his glove, then led her through the trees, following the glow that seemed to rise from the cuffs themselves.

In the forest, the trees whispered directions, and the drumbeat grew steady and sure. They found Mina’s scarf tangled in a thorn bush, caught on a crooked branch. Niko freed it, and the glow from the mittens brightened just enough for Mina to see again. They walked back toward the park, where the lanterns glowed and the town gathered for a humble winter festival.

Back home, the mittens’ glow softened into a gentle warmth at the wrists. Mina’s smile returned, and she tucked the scarf away with careful hands. The drums faded, but the memories stayed—memories of cocoa and family, of helping a friend, and of a street that felt a little less lonely because two strangers chose to share their warmth.

Before sleep, Niko pressed the mittens against his chest and whispered a promise: to pass them on to someone who needed a little warmth, when the time was right. And so the mittens waited, patient and bright, for the next person who needed a story to light their way.

The end.
