# Story: Add a new backlog item
ID: STORY-001
As a product owner, I want to add a new backlog item to the repository, so the team can track it.

## Goal
- Provide a starter backlog entry for future work.

## Acceptance Criteria
- A markdown file exists at `stories/new_story.md`.
- The file uses a consistent Story format with Title, ID, Role, Goal, and Acceptance Criteria.
- The template is easy to customize for future stories.

## Details
- Story ID: STORY-001
- Title: Add backlog story template
- Role: Product Owner
- Goal: Provide a reusable backlog item skeleton for new work
- Benefit: Streamlines story creation and alignment

> Note: This is a template. Please customize the content before starting work.
