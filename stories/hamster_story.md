# The Hamster Who Mapped the Maze

In a toyboard world of gears and squeaks, a curious hamster named Nibs runs the wheel of code. The maze of a project layout twists and turns, and every crate, module, and script is a wall in the winding path.

Nibs discovers a snag: a build script that stalls at the same spot every run. With a determined whisk of his tail, he maps the maze, tracing file paths and dependencies like breadcrumbs. Each loop reveals a new route around the obstacle, and a hidden cache shows the best way to squeeze performance from a tired task.

At last, Nibs patches the maze so the wheels spin freely again. The team cheers as the build completes in record time; the maze now a friendly garden of efficient paths.

Moral: small, tenacious steps turn a tangled maze into a smooth journey.
