# Waffle Story 3

Wally the Waffle woke to a morning that smelled of cinnamon and possibility. A breeze slipped through the kitchen window, ruffling his syrupy edges and inviting him to explore.

This time, Wally met a tiny crumb named Pico who carried a compass carved from a cinnamon stick. Pico whispered, "Adventure begins where curiosity leads you." Together they rolled toward the breakfast table, dodging the hill of butter and climbing the napkin hills like tiny climbers.

Their path led them to a teacup ocean, where milk waves lapped softly at the saucer shore. A brave strawberry flag stood in the middle, signaling a challenge: cross the brave plain of steam without getting foggy-eyed. Wally and Pico held hands (crumb and waffle), pressed forward, and sailed on a spoon-raft across the milky current.

On the other side, they found a lost raisin trapped in the toaster shadows. The toast hummed and sparkled with warmth, but there was a risk of burning if they stayed too long. Wally gently nudged the raisin free with a crunchy tip, and Pico steadied the raft as they pulled it back to safety.

Back at the plate, the raisin shared a new motto: "Courage grows when we help someone else grow." Wally realized adventures aren’t just about discovering new places, but about making room for friends to shine too.

From that day on, Wally and Pico hosted small breakfast quests for every guest, turning ordinary mornings into little journeys of kindness and courage.
