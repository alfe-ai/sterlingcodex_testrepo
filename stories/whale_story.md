# Whale Story: Echoes of the Deep

In the quiet blue, a lone whale rose with measured grace and exhaled a slow, patient song. The sea hummed in reply, as if the depths themselves were listening to the melody of a world unseen.

A small boat drifted on the horizon, its crew following the rhythm of the tide. With each note, the whale stitched a path through the water, guiding them past reefs and shadows toward a dawn they could not name.

When the first pale light touched the waves, the giant disappeared beneath the surface, leaving behind a memory that would steer the crew for years to come: to listen, to be brave, and to trust the whisper of the deep.
