The Banana That Shared Its Peel

In a sunny grove, a single banana hung near the tip of a leafy bunch, dreaming of what it would become. It was almost ripe, a little curved, and very curious about the world beyond its stem. The other fruits teased it gently: "Wait your turn," they said, "you'll become something delicious." But the banana couldn't help wondering who would taste its sweetness and whether there would be enough to go around.

One morning, a curious monkey named Lumo climbed up and peeked at the bananas. He sniffed the air, then looked at the lone banana and whispered, "If I only take what I can eat in a moment, I might waste the rest. But if we share, perhaps there will be enough to go around, and friendships will grow." The other monkeys gathered; some argued about who should get the first bite, while others sniffed at the bunch and thought of the feast to come.

The banana, feeling a flutter of responsibility, spoke softly: "I want to be eaten, yes, but I do not want to disappear without bringing joy to more than one mouth." So it suggested a plan— slice the banana into several pieces and offer each piece to different animals: a parrot who loves sweet fruit, a squirrel who stores energy for winter, a thoughtful tortoise who enjoys a quiet snack, and a shy young ant who never had a chance to share in a feast.

Lumo and the others agreed. They sliced the banana with care, sharing a piece with each creature who came near. A chorus of thanks rose from the grove as the piece by piece feast began. The parrot squawked with delight, the squirrel crouched happily with a sticky palm, the tortoise nodded in contentment, and the ant thanked them with a small cheer in the dust.

As the sun moved across the sky, the grove learned a quiet lesson: abundance grows not from taking more for oneself, but from making sure there is enough for everyone.

Moral: Sharing your sweetness multiplies happiness.
