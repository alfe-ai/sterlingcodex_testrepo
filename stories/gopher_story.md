# The Gopher and the Missing Byte

In the quiet fields of code, a small gopher named Pippin tunnels through the layers of a program. When a mysterious missing byte threatens to derail the day, Pippin digs deeper, mapping CPU cycles as if they were tunnels in a root cellar.

Along the way, Pippin meets a weary old bug who says, "Look for the boundary where things go wrong." Pippin follows the hint, stepping through tests, logging every dig, and finally uncovers an off-by-one error in a for-loop. Patch applied; tests pass; the garden hums with a steady rhythm.

Moral: small, careful digs uncover big truths.
