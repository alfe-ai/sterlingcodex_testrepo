# Gus and the Lantern in the Tunnels

Gus the gopher lived in a tunnel system that curled like a sleeping snake. One night, while digging, he found a walnut-shell lantern, dusty and cold. When he breathed on it, a small flame trembled to life.

He carried it deeper, into a long, silent stretch of tunnel where the earth hummed with secrets. Along the way, he met Luma the glowworm, who glowed softly, and Bristle the beetle, who could squeeze through the tightest crack. The lantern’s light danced on their faces, painting the walls with dancing shadows.

But the lantern needed more than a breath; it needed a song. Gus hummed a gentle tune, and soon Luma joined with a soft glow, Bristle clicked a beat with her tiny legs, and the tunnel replied with a warm breeze that carried their song forward.

Together they found a hidden shaft that opened to a small glade under a starry sky. The lantern’s flame grew brighter, enough to light the way for the other burrowers who would someday travel the same tunnels. They burned a path of light that glowed like morning.

When dawn arrived, the forest woke to a glow that hadn’t been there before. The gophers, moles, and field mice smiled as the lantern’s light revealed safe routes and new friendships.

Moral: Light grows stronger when shared, and even the smallest helpers can lead the way.
