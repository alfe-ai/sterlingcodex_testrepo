The Little Potatoes

Once upon a time in a quiet kitchen, a small, curious potato
named Pippin dreamed of traveling beyond the pantry door.
He rolled along the counter, met a brave carrot and a wise onion,
and together they learned that every ingredient has a place
at the table and a story worth telling.

The end.
