Sunny Sprout

On a bright morning, a small potato named Sunny woke to a warm beam of sun on the kitchen sill. Sunny worried they were ordinary, until a curious pea rolled over and whispered, “Even the smallest potato can change the recipe.”

Together with a shy carrot and a bold onion, Sunny practiced patience and curiosity. When the harvest feast began, they discovered that what you bring to the table—courage, kindness, and a pinch of humor—can turn a simple dish into a memory.

And so Sunny learned that every potato has a moment to shine, if it’s willing to roll toward the light.
